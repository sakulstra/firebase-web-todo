### Purpose
Firebase on web can be confusing at the beginning as there are not that much ressources out there as e.g. for meteor.
Anyways, firebase is a awesome platform to begin your programming experiments, it has even a free tier - so give it a try.
With this little tutorial/example repo I/We want to lower the burden to get started with firebase.
And no, this won't be a simple copy paste this tree files and now you have an app which works, but you could never deploy because it's actually a shitty project.
My goal here is to start from zero to a small/eventually useless app which includes app the party you actually need to create a real app!

### Steps
#### V0.1
Here we just created the project, added storybook
#### V0.2
Added a minimal ui and routing.
