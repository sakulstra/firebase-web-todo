What we did here:

#### Create react app
Create a new react app with `create-react-app` - you could also roll your own, but that would need a whole series on webpack and stuff.
// TODO: why storybook
#### Install storybook
Install storybook. Run 'getstorybook' in your newly created react-app

#### :dancing:
Awesome, now when you run `npm run start`, you already have a useless react icon spinning around!
When you run `npm run storybook` you can review the demo stories - boring content and useless buttons, wuuhu!
